## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v18.x or higher)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** or **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)**
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
- A **[Supabase](https://supabase.io/)** account (free tier available)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rophpad/alx-polly.git
cd alx-polly
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Supabase Setup

#### Create a Supabase Project

1. Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and create a new account
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be fully provisioned

#### Database Schema Setup

Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the required tables:

```sql
-- Create polls table
CREATE TABLE polls (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  options JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create votes table
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  poll_id UUID REFERENCES polls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  option_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE polls ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies for polls
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all polls" ON polls FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own polls" ON polls FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own polls" ON polls FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own polls" ON polls FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create RLS policies for votes
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all votes" ON votes FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert votes" ON votes FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX polls_user_id_idx ON polls(user_id);
CREATE INDEX polls_created_at_idx ON polls(created_at);
CREATE INDEX votes_poll_id_idx ON votes(poll_id);
CREATE INDEX votes_user_id_idx ON votes(user_id);
```

#### Get Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your project's **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL**
   - **Project API Key** (anon/public key)

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your Supabase credentials to `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional: For development
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

## üöÄ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
   - Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses
   - Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic
   - Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features

2. **Understand the Impact**:
   - For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact
   - Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed?
   - What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3. **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
   - Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it
   - Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes
   - Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
   - Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database
   - Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
   - Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2. **Use Your AI Assistant**:
   - This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you
   - Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues
   - Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors
   - When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it
